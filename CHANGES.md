Nirum changelog
===============

Version 0.3.1
-------------

To be released.

### Python target

 -  Fixed record/union deserializers to ignore unknown fields in data payload.
    Deserializers had raised `KeyError` before.  [#232]

[#232]: https://github.com/spoqa/nirum/issues/232


Version 0.3.0
-------------

Released on February 18, 2018.

### Language

 -  [Package](./docs/package.md) is now a new compilation unit of Nirum.
    Every Nirum package needs *package.toml* manifest file.
    [[#83], [#99]]
 -  Since a Nirum package can be compiled to more than one target languages,
    the `nirum` command became to have `-t`/`--target` required parameter.
    [[#106], [#111], [#114]]
 -  Added `-w`/`--watch` mode.  [[#91], [#104], [#218]]
 -  Annotations became able to have multiple arguments and every parameter
    became necessary to having its name (keyword).  [[#178], [#190], [#197]]
 -  Service methods became able to omit their return types.
    [[#179], [#199] by Yang Chun Ung]
 -  Added `@error` annotation to make a type to subclass an exception base
    class (e.g., [`Exception`][python-exception] in Python) when it's compiled
    to OO languages.  [[#38], [#127]]
 -  Union tag docstrings in parentheses became allowed.  [[#153], [#154]]
 -  Fixed a parser bug that a bare identifier (i.e., unquoted identifier) cannot
    start with a reserved keyword, e.g., `types` (`type` is reserved),
    `enumeration` (`enum` is reserved).  [[#184], [#189]]
 -  Fixed a parser bug that `import` names had been disallowing to have
    a trailing comma or newlines.  [[#202]]
 -  Fixed the `nirum` command bug that it had always terminated with exit code
    0 even when it errored.  [[#97], [#108]]

### Docs target

 -  A new target, `docs` is now available.  To generate docs for a Nirum
    package, specify `--target docs` option to the `nirum` command.
    [[#10], [#113], [#116], [#125], [#131], [#152], [#170], [#223]]

### Python target

 -  Now supports Python 2.7 besides Python 3.4 or later.
    [[#50], [#85], [#93], [#117], [nirum-python #22]]
 -  Now requires *nirum-python* 0.6.0 or later.  [[#119], [#141], [#146]]
 -  From now on, in order to compile a Nirum package to Python,
    *package.toml* manifest need [`targets.python`][targets.python] section
    and `targets.python.name` field.  [[#99]]
 -  Added `targets.python.minimum_runtime` option to specify the minimum
    version of *nirum-python* runtime library.  [[#118], [#119]]
 -  Added `targets.python.renames` option to rename module names when they
    are compiled to a Python module.  [[#121]]
 -  More package metadata became configurable.  [[#100]]
     -  `targets.python.description`  [[#174] by Seunghun Lee]
     -  `targets.python.license`  [[#180] by Seunghun Lee]
     -  `targets.python.keywords`  [[#183] by Seunghun Lee]
 -  Added new transport layer.  [[#149], [nirum-python #79], [nirum-python #92]]
     -  Generated constructors of service clients became to take a
        `nirum.transport.Transport` instance.
     -  Followed renamed/moved import paths of the runtime classes
        (e.g., `nirum.rpc.Service` became to `nirum.service.Service`).
     -  The way to avoid name collision between generated types and runtime
        classes is changed.  The runtime library had provided alternative names
        like `service_type` for `Service` and generated imports had been like
        `from nirum.rpc import service_type`, but it's now
        `from nirum.service import Service as service_type`.
 -  Record/union tag fields of an optional type can be omitted when
    the constructor is called.
    [[#70], [#165] by Seunghun Lee]
 -  Generated tag classes became qualified under its union class
    (e.g., `Shape.Rectangle` instead of `Rectangle`).
    Deprecated the old style and it is going to be obsolete in the near future.
    [[#68], [#193]]
 -  Generated service clients became qualified under its service class
    (e.g., `FooService.Client` instead of `FooService_Client`).
    Deprecated the old style and it is going to be obsolete in the near future.
    [[#167], [#222]].
 -  Generated serializers became independent from *nirum-python* runtime
    library.  [[#160], [#201], [#203], [#204]]
 -  Deserializers became to show multiple error messages at a time.
    [[#168], [#224]]
 -  Generated Python classes became having `__nirum_type__` metadata for RTTI.
    [[nirum-python #34], [#192]]
 -  Generated service classes became having `__nirum_method_annotations__`
    metadata for processing annotations.  [[#194]]
 -  Docstrings in a Nirum schema became to generate corresponding Python
    docstrings.  [[#102], [#128]]
 -  Sets, lists, and maps became compiled to immutable data structures
    so that thay are easily hashable.  [[nirum-python #49], [#123]]
 -  Fixed a bug that implicit ancestor packages hadn't been generated even
    if they have submodules.  [[#92], [#105]]
 -  Fixed a bug that a generated Python code had raised
    [`NameError`][python-name-error] when a referring type is above than
    a referred type.  [[#138], [nirum-python #88], [#146]]
 -  Fixed a bug that a generated Python `enum` code had became broken
    when an enum type has a member named `mro`.  [[#185], [#188]]

### Et cetera

 -  The officialy distributed executable binaries for Linux became
    independent from [glibc]; instead statically linked to [musl].  [#216]
 -  The Docker image now has `nirum` command in `PATH`.  [[#155]]
 -  The Docker image became based and built on [Alpine Linux][] so that
    the image is now much lighter.

### Language

 -  The `boxed` keyword was renamed to `unboxed`.  [[#65], [#81]]

    [[#40], [#73]]
 -  Docstrings became merely a syntactic sugar of `@docs` annotation.
    [[#53], [#57]]

    been broken.  [[#55], [#66]]
